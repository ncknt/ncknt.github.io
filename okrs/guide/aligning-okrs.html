What you're going to contribute to is your alignment. </p> <div class="text-center"> <img class="guide-img" src="../images/guide/path3382.9c98bcc1.png" alt="Typical alignment of an OKR"> <div><small><i>Typical alignment of an OKR.</i></small></div> </div> <p class="push-32"> It can tempting to make your current job assignments fit into one of the OKRs "above". This often feels unnatural and forced. OKRs don't necessarily capture all your job duties. But if you really want to track some unrelated goals in an OKR, don't align it. </p> <h4>Optional team OKRs</h4> <p> When using <a href="individual-goals">individual OKRs</a>, you may wonder whether you need an OKR specific to your team. </p> <p> It's simpler to avoid team OKRs if you can. Only add a team goal when it is more specific than its parent. Perhaps you want to track a certain KPI or lay out a team plan. </p> <p> For instance, with a company-wide goal of <i>Make our customers love us</i>, a good customer support team OKR could be <i>Decrease customer wait time</i> while a good R&amp;D team OKR would be <i>Add 2 of the top 3 most requested features</i>. </p> <p> A sure sign that a team OKR is superfluous is when its key results are identical to its parent's. </p> <p class="guide-note"> In <strong>larger organizations</strong>, it's tempting to reflect the organization chart into a hierarchy of goals. We recommend against cascading deeper than 2 or 3 levels to keep things connected and real for employees. </p> <h4>Forcing alignment</h4> <p> Forcing individual OKRs to only contribute to one of their team's OKRs makes things simpler at first but can become counterproductive as employees are locked into a narrow set of objectives. Let employees explore and contribute to other OKRs and think outside the box. </p> <div class="text-center"> <img class="guide-img" src="../images/guide/path4958.483bff92.png" alt="OKRs can contribute to different teams"> </div> <p class="push-32"> Of course, employees don't have to contribute to ALL of their team's goals. </p> <div class="text-center"> <img class="guide-img" src="../images/guide/path5266.4a7459df.png" alt="OKRs don't have to contribute to all team goals"> </div> <h4>What about cross-team work?</h4> <p> Cross-team work and collaboration is a more advanced way to align goals that fosters greater cooperation. </p> <div class="text-center"> <img class="guide-img" src="../images/guide/rect5392.c8b7b9a7.png" alt="Employees can contribute to other team OKRs"> </div> <p class="push-32"> For instance, if the engineering team is split geographically and in different departments, having common goals for them makes more sense. You can find common goals for teams that usually collaborate tightly such as QA and Software Development. </p> <p> The downside to cross-team goals is a more complicated management: someone needs to be in charge of organizing and monitoring the various individual OKRs. </p> <p> That's why we only recommend this setup for more experienced teams that need less oversight. </p> <h4>Finding the right model</h4> <p> Team goals aren't all or nothing. You can start by limiting individual OKRs to cascade from team OKRs and relax the rule as needed. Remember though that the simpler and natural the alignment, the better. </p> <div class="push-32 text-right"> <a class="btn btn-gray" href="./writing-good-goals">Writing useful OKRs &gt;</a> </div> </section> </div> </div>  <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="../js/workfuze.3aaab7ad.js"></script> </body> </html>
