But if fundamental assumptions change - such as a change in the business, or the realization that what you're doing isn't working: absolutely! </p> <p> It's obviously more problematic to change company goals because of their large impact. However, it's better to stop a goal that is going nowhere - especially early on. </p> <hr>  <a name="stretch"></a> <h4>Employees routinely get 100% on their goals. Am I doing it wrong?</h4> <p> Not necessarily. As we note, <a href="stretch-goals">stretch goals</a> aren't for everyone and perhaps your organization isn't ready for them. First thing to do is to objectively determine if performance is stagnating. Again your OKR tool should help here. </p> <p> If you feel that goals have become an administrative task, consider making them gradually more difficult. Start at the top and work your way down. Make sure that even company-wide goals have key results. </p> <hr>  <a name="care"></a> <h4>How to make people care?</h4> <p> The most common reason for apathy in the face of goals is that employees don't believe this is something management truly cares about. <a href="introducing-okrs">Explain</a> why you're working with OKRs and lead by example. </p> <hr>  <a name="sandbag"></a> <h4>How to avoid sandbagging?</h4> <p> It can be done by the manager making sure the key results really equates success. Peers can also play a role when OKRs are shared within a team. </p> <hr>  <a name="retro"></a> <h4>My team just finished its goals. Now what?</h4> <p> At the end of a goal, whether you have individual goals or not, the team should get together and rate each OKR. </p> <p> It's also useful to judge if the goal was too difficult or too easy. This is part of the learning experience. </p> <hr>  <a name="process"></a> <h4>How do I evaluate our goal process?</h4> <p> The best way to check if your process is working is to ask employees and line managers. </p> <ul> <li>Was the timeframe adequate?</li> <li>Was the goal difficulty well calibrated?</li> <li>How long did it take you to write your goals?</li> <li>How often have you updated or interacted with your goals?</li> </ul> <hr>  <a name="consultant"></a> <h4>Should I hire a consultant to help us draft OKRs?</h4> <p> OKRs are quite simple to manage so technically there's no need to hire a consultant. Your OKR tool should help employees write their goals. </p> <p> But companies also routinely get external help with strategy and to diagnose any organizational change needed. </p> <hr>  <a name="tool"></a> <h4>Should I use a software to manage my OKRs?</h4> <p> We're a <i>*bit*</i> biased since that's our bread and butter. But to be honest, not everybody needs a full-fledged system. Some people are happy with an Excel spreadsheet, others keep track of OKRs in Trello. </p> <p> It may be fine in the beginning but it breaks down after 10 employees (~ 30 goals per quarter to navigate, update and analyze). Even for a single team with just team goals, checking in and automatically sharing information is a valuable first step. </p> </section> </div> </div>  <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="../js/workfuze.3aaab7ad.js"></script> </body> </html>
