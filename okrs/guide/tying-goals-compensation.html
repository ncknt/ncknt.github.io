A simple approach is to wait until goals have been rated and use that rating to determine the variable part of a compensation.</p> <p>Think twice: most goals are actually a bad fit for this. What do you think happens when you ask people to come up with the targets they need to meet to get their bonus or raise?</p> <div class="text-center"> <img src="../images/guide/sandbag.25bf8466.jpg" alt="Employees Setting Goals"> <figcaption>Employees setting goals in preparation for their bonuses</figcaption> </div> <p class="push-32"> Yep. It's human nature and is actually the rational thing to do for employees. They set targets that they know they can meet. So what are you to do? </p> <p> Of course, managers could check employees are not sandbagging but it puts the burden on your managers and assumes they always know best. It also removes the employee buy-in from the process: the employee should "own" the goal. In addition, your hidden high performers now have an incentive to remain hidden for a short term gain. You won't coerce anyone into becoming a high performing employee by raising their targets. Give them the means to express their talent and the room to try out new things. </p> <h4>Left Brain Effect</h4> There is an even more compelling - yet often ignored - reason to keep goal ratings and compensation separated: it <a title="Large Stakes and Big Mistakes" href="https://www.bostonfed.org/economic/wp/wp2005/wp0511.pdf" target="_blank">has been found</a> repeatedly that the higher the reward the worse the performance for creative tasks (<em>creative</em> is loosely applied here.) We recommend you watch this talk from Dan Pink. On top of being entertaining, it should resonate with a lot of HR folks. <p class="push-32"> <iframe src="https://embed-ssl.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation.html" width="690" height="389" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p> <h4>When It Works</h4> There are two categories of goals where the drawbacks mentioned above are minimal: <ul> <li>Task-based goals where the task is well-defined and nothing other than the task is expected from the employee.</li> <li>Goals where only the result matters. This is traditionally the case in sales functions.</li> </ul> In these cases, we recommend a mixed approach: determine the bonus based on metrics-driven goals and let employees add inspirational goals. <h4>So What to Do?</h4> <ul> <li>Don't use goal ratings directly in a performance evaluation: the final performance rating should not be your goal rating. Make sure employees know this is the case.</li> <li>Don't punish employees who miss really ambitious goals. It doesn't mean you should compromise on low performance but rather that you should aim high.</li> <li>Do use goals as a talking point during a performance evaluation. Consider how the goal was executed by the employee and the team.</li> <li>If your evaluation process involves peers, consider sharing individual goals at least with peers.</li> </ul> <div class="push-32 text-right"> <a class="btn btn-gray" href="fixing-disorganization">Fixing Disorganization &gt;</a> </div> </section> </div> </div>  <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="../js/workfuze.3aaab7ad.js"></script> </body> </html>
