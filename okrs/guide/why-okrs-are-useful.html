But in practice, employees only pay attention to their goals at review time. And after a whole year, these goals tend to become irrelevant. </p> <p> OKRs take SMART goals further and give <strong>ownership</strong> of goals to employees and teams. They're a daily motivational tool as well as a means of communication and coordination for managers. </p> <h4>Benefits for your company</h4> <ol class="guide-spaced"> <li> <strong>Focused organization</strong>: by writing just a few goals, you go through the exercise of choosing what's important. It's true for the organization but also for teams and individual contributors. </li> <li> <strong>Reactivity</strong>: OKRs are typically set more frequently than traditional goals to keep them concrete and measurable (and add a bit of variety to work!). Teams are better able to react to changing business conditions. </li> <li> <strong>Effective communication</strong>: goals are a <a href="communicating-with-goals">great means of communication</a> for company and team leaderships. Your message will stick with employees better than any email announcement you could write. </li> <li> <strong>Transparency</strong> comes with OKRs and is how you're able to empower employees to make better decisions. </li> <li> <strong>Clear expectations</strong>: OKRs are a more sophisticated way to manage SMART goals and just like any SMART goal, they convey expectations. </li> <li> <strong>More engaged employees</strong>: an employee who owns a goal, has a greater sense of responsibility and is more engaged with a job they helped defined. </li> <li> <strong>Cooperation and alignment</strong>: OKRs are normally public. Teams sharing goals cooperate and are less constrained by hierarchical boundaries. </li> <li> <strong>Better performance</strong>: OKRs can be a way - all things equal - to measure performance at an individual level - and therefore to aim for higher results. </li> <li> <strong>Faster onboarding</strong>: When everyone can see current and past goals, new team members can immediately get the history of who they're working with. </li> <li> <strong>Easier performance evaluations</strong>: OKRs are often presented as unrelated to performance reviews. But virtually everyone uses OKRs during performance evaluation. If you <a href="individual-goals">proceed with caution</a>, OKRs are a great tool that'll make the dreaded performance review more useful. </li> </ol> <p> OKRs will make goals matter in your organization. Not for the sake of having goals, but so that each employee understands the context of their work and track their progress - like having a personal coach. </p> <p class="push-32"> Now you're convinced, let's see what exactly an OKR consists in. </p> <div class="push-32 text-right"> <a class="btn btn-gray" href="./what-are-okrs">What's in an OKR? &gt;</a> </div> </section> </div>  <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="../js/workfuze.3aaab7ad.js"></script> </body> </html>
